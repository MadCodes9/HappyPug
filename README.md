# HappyPug

ingredient list of any dog food product and  the results provides the user with a detailed description 
and rating of each ingredient found in their dog food product. The user is also supplied with a pie chart 
analysis that shows the percentage of ingredients in a given category. In addition, an overall rating is 
determined by inspection of each ingredient rating and first five ingredients found.
